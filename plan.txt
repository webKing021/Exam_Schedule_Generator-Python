# Exam Scheduling Generator Application Plan

## Overview
Create a comprehensive GUI application for teachers to generate and manage exam schedules. The application will build upon the existing constraint programming approach but add more features and a user-friendly interface.

## Core Features
1. Course/Subject Management
   - [✓] Add/edit/delete subjects with details (course code, name, type, semester, etc.)
   - [✓] Assign subjects to semesters
   - [✓] Import/export subject lists

2. Exam Schedule Generation
   - [✓] Generate optimized exam schedules using constraint programming
   - [✓] Configure exam parameters (start date, exam types, gap between exams)
   - [✓] Room allocation for exams
   - [✓] Handle different exam types (theory, practical, internal, external)
   - [✓] Skip scheduling exams on Sundays

3. Schedule Visualization
   - [✓] Calendar view of the generated schedule
   - [✓] List view with filtering options
   - [✓] Visual indicators for potential conflicts
   - [✓] Edit existing schedule items
   - [✓] Add new items to existing schedules

4. Export Options
   - [✓] Export to PDF
   - [✓] Export to CSV format
   - [✓] Print functionality (via PDF)
